# FittingRoom.ai - Workshop Notes

## Initial Implementation (Current)
- Created basic UI scaffolding for all screens
- Implemented navigation between screens
- Added placeholder components for future functionality
- Set up project structure with proper organization

## Project Structure Changes
- Created proper Xcode project structure with FittingRoom.xcodeproj
- Organized files into correct directory structure:
  - FittingRoom/
    - Components/
    - Screens/
    - Resources/
- Fixed PrimaryButton parameter order in preview
- Added Info.plist with required permissions
- Set up Assets.xcassets for app icons

## Recent Updates
- Implemented dark theme UI matching design
- Added full image picker functionality for both camera and photo library
- Created proper WardrobeItem model with image support
- Implemented X buttons for removing items
- Added proper state management for selected items
- Implemented 2x2 grid layout for clothing categories (Top, Bottom, Shoes, Hat)
- Added proper image containment in grid cells with .clipped() and .frame constraints
- Made Generate button always visible (grayed out when disabled)
- Made all clothing categories optional - Generate enabled with at least one item
- Improved visual hierarchy with consistent spacing and rounded corners
- Added proper padding and visual separation between grid cells

## User Flow
1. Home Screen:
   - User adds selfie (via camera or photo library)
   - User adds clothes items through:
     - Camera
     - Photo library
   - Each added item shows as an actual image with X button
   - Generate button appears when they have both selfie and at least one item

2. Add Item Flow:
   - User taps "+" to add new item
   - Can choose camera or photo library
   - Adds item name and category
   - Item appears in the clothes section with X button

3. Generate Flow:
   - Generate button appears once requirements met
   - Shows preview of generated outfit
   - Options to save or regenerate

## Known Issues
- Image picker is now implemented but needs testing on real devices
- Authentication is currently bypassed with a simple toggle
- No actual AI integration for outfit generation
- No persistent storage for wardrobe items

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
- [x] Implement proper image picker functionality
- [ ] Add proper authentication flow
- [x] Create data models for wardrobe items
- [ ] Implement persistent storage for wardrobe items
- [ ] Add proper error handling throughout the app

### Short-term Improvements
- [ ] Enhance UI with animations and transitions
- [ ] Add loading states for async operations
- [ ] Implement proper form validation
- [ ] Add unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline

### Medium-term Goals
- [ ] Integrate with backend services
- [ ] Implement AI-powered outfit generation
- [ ] Add user profile management
- [ ] Implement cloud storage for images
- [ ] Add analytics tracking

### Long-term Vision
- [ ] Implement social features
- [ ] Add subscription model
- [ ] Create advanced AI features
- [ ] Expand to other platforms (Android, web)
- [ ] Build community features

## Technical Debt
- Need to refactor repeated UI components
- Improve state management as app grows
- Optimize image handling for performance
- Add proper documentation throughout codebase

## Ideas for Future Features
- Virtual try-on with AR
- Style recommendations based on weather
- Outfit calendar for planning
- Integration with e-commerce platforms
- Style quiz for personalized recommendations

Workshop Changes - Session Notes

1. Project Structure Cleanup
   - Moved OpenAIService into FittingRoomApp.swift for better integration
   - Removed Services directory to simplify structure
   - Updated project file references to reflect new organization
   - Fixed file dependencies and imports

2. Authentication Flow Improvements
   - Added AuthManager as ObservableObject to handle auth state
   - Implemented proper environment object injection
   - Fixed navigation between AuthScreen and main TabView
   - Added signIn/signOut functionality

3. WardrobeScreen Modernization
   - Updated to iOS 16+ NavigationAPI (removed deprecated NavigationLink)
   - Created WardrobeItemCard component for consistent item display
   - Added AddItemCard component for the add button
   - Fixed item addition callback flow

4. OpenAI Integration Preparation
   - Set up OpenAIService singleton structure
   - NOTE: Will update from "dall-e-3" to appropriate 4o model when available
   - Prepared prompt engineering for outfit generation:
     * Main prompt focuses on photorealistic integration
     * Negative prompt handles common generation issues
   - Request structure ready with:
     * HD quality settings
     * 1024x1024 size
     * Base64 image handling for selfie and wardrobe items
   - Currently returns placeholder image (original selfie) until API integration

5. UI/UX Improvements (Latest)
   - Updated WardrobeScreen to use dropdown category selector
   - Removed mock wardrobe data for clean start
   - Made empty state card in HomeScreen clickable to add clothes
   - Fixed text capitalization ("Your Clothes")
   - Updated selfie prompt to "Take a photo of yourself or choose from your library"

Status: App is running with working auth flow and wardrobe management. 
Next: Awaiting API key and correct model endpoint for final integration.
